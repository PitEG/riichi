# RIICHI
I NEED IT

comes with a server and a webclient to play with one

## Initial Plan

server's only goal is to send each player's actions to the others.
for multiplayer games, it should also be the only one who knows what the unknown tiles are.

webclient can do all the logic, so there's room for developing single player modes if desired.
